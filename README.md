# Train Scheduler

Front-end train schedule application that accepts user input to add new train name, destination, start time and frequency to schedule. The app then appends the schedule table with next arrival based on current time and frequency of train stops. Train information is stored in Firebase for data persistence and data is retreived from database on load. Schedules refresh every minute to reflect updated arrival information.
